### Bouquet Formation

You are provided with **n** roses and an array `arr`, where `arr[i]` denotes the day on which the \(i^{th}\) rose will bloom.

Each bouquet must consist of exactly **k** consecutive roses (in terms of their positions in the array, not the days they bloom).

Your task is to find the **minimum number of days** required to form at least **m** bouquets. Return `-1` if it's not possible to create the desired number of bouquets.

### Example 1:
#### **Input**:
```
n = 6, k = 2, m = 2
arr = [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
```

#### **Output**:
