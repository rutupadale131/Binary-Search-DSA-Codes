# Binary Search Codes
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems focused on Binary Search, which I have personally solved. It includes various implementations and solutions to common problems involving Binary Search, written in C++. Each code example is well-documented to help understand the underlying concepts and techniques used.
