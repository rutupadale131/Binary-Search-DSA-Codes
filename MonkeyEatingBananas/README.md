### Monkey Eating Bananas

A monkey is given **n** piles of bananas, where the \(i^{th}\) pile has `arr[i]` bananas. An integer **h** is also given, which denotes the total time (in hours) within which all the bananas must be eaten.

Each hour, the monkey consumes **m** bananas from a single pile. If a pile has fewer than **m** bananas, the monkey eats all the bananas in that pile and stops for that hour.

Your task is to determine the **minimum value of m** such that the monkey can finish eating all the bananas within **h** hours.
